# webtorrent-json-store
Webtorrent backend for storing and updating JSON. Data storage for website and search engine.

Since Webtorrent only serves a static set of files, I will use some sort of incremental backup scheme, creating new webtorrent-files for updates and do a full new webtorrent file every on a regular basis.
